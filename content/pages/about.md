# About Gluten Ministry

Gluten Ministry is a faith-based community dedicated to supporting individuals and families navigating gluten-free living. Founded on the principles of love, support, and shared meals, we believe that dietary restrictions should never be a barrier to fellowship and community.

## Our Story

Our ministry began when several members of our congregation were diagnosed with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. We realized there was a need for a supportive community that understood both the spiritual and practical challenges of maintaining a gluten-free lifestyle.

- **Recipe sharing and testing**
- **Community support groups**
